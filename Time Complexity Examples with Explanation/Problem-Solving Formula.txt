Problem-Solving Formula

1. Understand the Problem

Read the Problem Statement Carefully: Make sure you understand what is being asked.
Identify Inputs and Outputs: Determine what inputs you will receive and what outputs are expected.
Clarify Requirements: Ensure you understand any constraints and special requirements.

2. Plan Your Approach

Break Down the Problem: Divide the problem into smaller, manageable parts.
Identify Key Concepts: Determine which data structures and algorithms might be useful.
Develop a Strategy: Outline the steps needed to solve the problem.

3. Write Pseudocode

Outline Your Logic: Write pseudocode or a high-level description of your solution.
Ensure Clarity: Make sure each step is clear and logical.

4. Implement the Solution

Write the Code: Translate your pseudocode into actual code.
Follow Best Practices: Use meaningful variable names, proper indentation, and comments where necessary.

5. Test Your Solution

Create Test Cases: Design test cases to cover different scenarios, including edge cases.
Run Your Tests: Execute your test cases and verify that your code produces the correct results.
Debug if Necessary: If there are errors, use debugging techniques to find and fix the issues.

6. Optimize Your Solution

Analyze Complexity: Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution.
Improve Efficiency: Look for ways to optimize your code if it is not efficient enough.

7. Review and Refactor

Review Your Code: Make sure your code is clean, readable, and follows best practices.
Refactor if Necessary: Improve your code structure without changing its functionality.

EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH

Let's apply this formula to a simple example problem:

Problem: Given an array of integers, return the indices of the two numbers that add up to a specific target.

1. Understand the Problem

Inputs: An array of integers and a target integer.
Outputs: Indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.
Constraints: Each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

2. Plan Your Approach

Break Down the Problem: We need to find two numbers in the array that sum up to the target.
Identify Key Concepts: Use a hash map to store the indices of the numbers we have seen so far.
Develop a Strategy: For each number in the array, check if the complement (target - current number) exists in the hash map. If it does, return the indices.

3. Write Pseudocode

Initialize an empty hash map
Iterate over each number in the array with its index
    Calculate the complement (target - current number)
    If the complement is in the hash map
        Return the current index and the index of the complement
    Otherwise, add the current number and its index to the hash map

4. Implement the Solution

public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("No two sum solution");
}

5. Test Your Solution

Create Test Cases:
twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9) should return [0, 1]
twoSum([3, 2, 4], 6) should return [1, 2]
twoSum([3, 3], 6) should return [0, 1]
Run Your Tests: Ensure all test cases pass.
Debug if Necessary: If a test fails, use debugging tools to find and fix the issue.

6. Optimize Your Solution

Analyze Complexity: The solution runs in O(n) time and uses O(n) space.
Improve Efficiency: This solution is already optimal for this problem.

7. Review and Refactor

Review Your Code: Ensure the code is clear and follows best practices.
Refactor if Necessary: No refactoring needed in this case.

By following this structured approach, you can systematically tackle coding problems and improve your problem-solving skills over time.
