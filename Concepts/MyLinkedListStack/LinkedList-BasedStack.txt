ADVANTAGES:
Dynamic Size: The stack can grow and shrink dynamically without needing to resize an underlying
array. No wasted space since you only allocate memory as needed.

Memory Efficiency: No need to worry about array resizing, and it can handle large numbers of 
elements without any additional overhead.


DISADVANTAGES:
Memory Overhead: Each element requires additional memory to store the reference (or pointer) 
to the next node.

Performance: Access time might be slightly slower than an array-based stack due to the 
overhead of managing pointers and the linked list structure, though operations are still O(1).
