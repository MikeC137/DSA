Key Concepts of a Priority Queue

Priority: Each element in the queue has a priority associated with it, which is used to 
determine the order of removal.

Max-priority queue: Elements with the highest priority are removed first.
Min-priority queue: Elements with the lowest priority are removed first.

Basic Operations:

Insert (enqueue): Insert an element into the queue with a given priority.
Extract (dequeue): Remove the element with the highest priority.
Peek (front/top): Return (but do not remove) the element with the highest priority.
IsEmpty: Check whether the queue is empty.
