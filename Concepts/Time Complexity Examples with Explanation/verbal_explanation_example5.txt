Here, we have a function called processArray which accepts two parameters, array A and array B. The first thing we see in the function is a declaration and initialization of a variable called result. This operation takes O(1) constant time. Next, we have a nested loop. The outer loop runs from 0 to the length of the array A. The inner loop runs from 0 to the length of the array A again, and inside the inner loop, we have a basic arithmetic operation. The time complexity of the arithmetic operation is O(1) constant time. This means that for each iteration of the outer loop, which is n times, the inner loop will run n times as well, resulting in a total of n^2 iterations. Ultimately, the time complexity of the nested loop is O(n^2).

Next, we have a single loop that runs from 0 to the length of the array B. Inside the loop, we have a basic arithmetic operation. The time complexity of the arithmetic operation is O(1) constant time. This loop runs m times, where m is the length of array B. Therefore, the time complexity of this loop is O(m).

Finally, we have a return statement that takes O(1) constant time. 

Overall, the time complexity of the processArray function is O(n^2 + m) because the dominant term is n^2. Therefore, the time complexity of the processArray function is O(n^2). As the size of the input arrays A and B increases, the time complexity of the function will grow quadratically.
