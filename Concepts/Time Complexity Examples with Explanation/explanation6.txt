We have a function called "printPairs" which accepts an array of integers.
First thing we see in the function is the declaration and initialization
of an integer variable called "n". The assigned value of variable "n" is
the length of the array. 

Next, we have a nested for loop. The outer loop runs from 0 to the length
of the array. The inner loop runs from 0 to the length of the array as 
well. Inside the inner loop we have a print statement which takes O(1) 
constant time. The time complexity of this function is O(n^2) because the
inner loop will run n times for each iteration of the outer loop, where n
is the length of the array. Therefore, as the input size increases the 
time complexity of the function increases quadratically.
