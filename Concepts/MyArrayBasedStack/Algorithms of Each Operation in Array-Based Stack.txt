ALGORITHMS OF EACH OPERATION IN ARRAY-BASED STACK

1. E push(E item)
    a. Check if the list is full. If full, double it's size
    b. Add the element at the top of the stack (end of the array)
    c. Increment the size of the stack
    Time Complexity: If full array O(n) --- If array not full O(1)  
    Amortized Time Complexity: O(1) over a series of add operations 
    if the array size grows geometrically (e.g., doubling).
